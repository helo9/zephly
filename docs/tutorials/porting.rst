Porting guide
=============

This guide describes how to port this software to not supported flight
controllers. In the Zephyr context this is called board porting, already
described in the `Board porting guide`_. Following this guide is a good
idea. Instead of creating the boards inside Zephyrs boards directory,
we use the boards directory inside zephly.
