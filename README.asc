the toolchain.

. Create an empty folder for the fc development and use west to download the sources

mkdir fcdev
west init --m https://github.com/helo9/frickelflightcontrol --mr main fcdev
cd fcdev
west update
west zephyr-export
----

`west` has downloaded the _frickelflightcontrol_ repo into _fcdev/frickelflightcontrol_
