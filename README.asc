WARNING: This software is in very early development state.

Attempt to implement a flight controller based on zephyr rtos.

== Getting started

. Follow the zephyr Getting Started Instructions and ensure system and python dependencies are installed. Furthermore consider installing the zephyr toolchain to simplify later usage.

. Create an empty folder for the fc development and use west to download the sources
+
----
mkdir fcdev
west init -m https://github.com/helo9/zephly --mr main fcdev
cd fcdev
west update
west zephyr-export
----
+
`west` has downloaded the _zephly_ repo into _fcdev/zephly_

. Build for Copter Control 3D to verify installation:
+
----
cd zephly/
west build --board=openpilot_cc3d -s app
----

== Overview

.Controller Diagram

The AttitudeRateController takes radio commands from the pilot as setpoint and uses the gyroscope measurements to calculate moment and force demand. This is translated into four individual motor outputs by our mixer. The Output forwards them to the motor speed controllers.
